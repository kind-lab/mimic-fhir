-- Generate codes for diagnosis-icd10 codesystem
-- Take codes used in mimiciv_hosp.diagnosis_icd and mimic_ed.diagnosis
-- Combine all the codes from MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-ED to make sure all ICD codes captured
-- Need to trim to remove whitespaces, or validator will fail it
-- FUTURE: fhir should have all these codes in the terminology server, but only have fragmented version.
--         So can swap to the fhir version when it is complete
